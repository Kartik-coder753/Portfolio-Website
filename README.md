# Portfolio-Website
KARTIK.dev is a simple and modern personal portfolio website where I share who I am, my skills, experience, projects, and how to contact me. Itâ€™s clean, mobile-friendly, has cool animations, and is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Just a neat way to show my work!
